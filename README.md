## Stanford CS149 Parallel Computing Programming Assignments (Fall 2022)

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments that appeared in the Fall 2022 version
of the course. I might try to also configure AWS to run the AWS Trainium assignments from Fall 2024,
since the course uses a private AMI for that one.

The first two assignments were ran on a macbook (M1 Pro). The third was on NVIDIA T4 GPU on AWS,
and the last one also on AWS on the suggested instance (32 vCPUs). I guess you can also run it on
a x86-64 machine running ubuntu 22.04 but it has to have many cores (16 physical, 32 threads, for instance).
